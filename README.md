* Chlamydia was highly prevalent in females than males, while Syphilis was highly prevalent in males than females. Gonorrhea was also slightly more prevalent in females than in males.
* Chlamydia and gonorrhea cases tend to increase as population increases.
* Illinois, Alabama, Virginia and Florida had the highest number of STD cases. California, Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma also had high number of STD cases. The age groups dominating these cases are age group 15-19, 20-24, 25-29 and 30-34.
* The sates with the highest prevalence for STD in 2014 were; Alaska, Mississippi, South Carolina, Alabama and Louisiana. New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Illinois, Georgia and North Carolina also had high prevalence for STD.
